            <h2>Fire &amp; Ice</h2>
            <p>In April 2010, Eyjafjallajökull, the infamous volcano in Iceland, erupted. A fellow college classmate from Syracuse University and co-owner of D-65, Seth Resnick, quickly organized a trip for a dozen photographers to go to Iceland to photograph the volcano. Then a second, larger eruption occurred wreaking havoc on world-wide air travel. Our small group came from all corners of the world -- Australia, Germany, Bermuda, and 5 different states in the US. Four people flew in on a private plane. Several us were diverted to Glasglow, Scotland and two of us endured a slow, bumpy, red-eye bus ride from the north of Iceland to the capital. Much to my amazement, the great photographer, Eric Meola, joined us on the trip. Lucklily, the very first night we arrived at the volcano, it was erupting, and it was absolutely spectacular. Everyone piled out of our mobile base of operation &quot;The Mantruck&quot;, set up tripods in front of the truck and began shooting...except for me.  Like a dying animal wanting to slip into the forest to be alone, I left the group and walked toward the volcano; I didn&#x27;t want my fellow photographers to see me struggle setting up or feel burdened to help me during this critical moment. As I set up my tripod, I knew I wanted to use my longest lens. It turned out my 300 mm 2.8 was the only lens I had with a plate for my tripod. Then it was magical. Major fiery, eruptions, throwing rocks the size of cars, blazing red and black smoke swirling high above the glacier, all against a clear, midnight blue night sky. Every time I go away on a trip, my hope is to come home with one image that I love. This is my favorite and most memorable photograph from that trip. Eyjafjallajökull, Iceland. May 2010. </p>

            <p>There are icebergs in Antarctica that &quot;glow&quot; in tones of blue and green. This iceberg was exceptional. With my widest lens, a 14 mm, I dropped my camera below the edge of the zodiac and tilted the camera up to show the intense &quot;glowing&quot; ceiling of this iceberg. As though that weren&#x27;t enough, there was a small &quot;door&quot; glowing in blue on the left side of the frame. The color and light was spectacular. Pleneau Bay, Iceberg Graveyard, Antarctica.

            <h2>Cat Walk</h2>
            <p>I was in Provence by myself photographing in southern France. I woke up on this morning and said to myself: &quot;It&#x27;s your birthday -- try to take a photograph you&#x27;ll love&quot;. I drove to Gordes, a beautiful and charming old village. A few minutes after I had arrived, I realized there were too many tourists, so I headed back to my car to leave. Just beyond the parking area, there were two women standing on the grass consumed in conversation. Initially, I was drawn to the woman&#x27;s hat and &quot;something moving&quot; on her shoulders. I photographed an entire roll of this little Siamese kitten, without either woman realizing I was there. The entire roll is hysterical; this little kitten was walking around, nibbling on her ear, looking at me. After I was done photographing, I talked with the women and found out that the kitten&#x27;s name was Artemis. Five years later, I returned to Gordes with my husband and gave them printed notecards of this image.  Gordes, France. June 15, 1996.</p>

            <h2>Shadow House</h2>
            <p>When I was studying abroad during my junior year of college, the student rail pass was an inexpensive way to travel around Europe. I had always wanted to go to Austria because &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; was one of my favorite movies. So when I arrived in Salzburg, of course I had to take &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; tour. We visited the Nonneberg Abbey where scenes from the movie were filmed. I don&#x27;t particular like tours, so I wandered away from the group and was admiring this beautiful view. There was a lone house with an interesting cross road out in the snowy field. The late day setting sun cast a very long shadow of the house and I was intrigued by the long shadow compared to the size of the house. As I was framing my shot so the shadow would fall in the center of the crossroad it was my good fortune that two people were walking on the road. This is the oldest photograph in my portfolio.  Salzburg, Austria. December 1978.</p>

            <p>&quot;Alaska&quot; was my first cat; he was white. One day, Alaska went from being my pet, to becoming a subject for a possible portfolio shot. I saw him jump up on the windowsill in my bedroom and sit behind the lace curtain as the sun was setting. Something distracted him, he looked down; it was probably a little insect. My heart skipped a beat and I grabbed my camera. My photography professor and mentor, &quot;TR&quot;, once challenged me to try to take a photograph in a very familiar place; within a few feet from where I sleep. This photograph has always represented that moment to me; when something out of the ordinary occurs in a place that you are accustomed to seeing every day. Kings Point, New York. August 1985.</p>

            <h2>Rusty Barn</h2>
            <p>While traveling in Iceland, there was an old barn on the side of the road that had beautiful colors of rust and paint. This particular section was of particular interest to me not only for it&#x27;s beautiful subtle colors and texture, but because it is one of my favorite palates. The combination of colors is pleasing to the eye, the weathered look gives it a feel of history and the texture of the barn gives it depth and dimension. Presenting this section as a close-up graphic image highlights the details and the interaction of these earth tone colors. Iceland. May 2010.</p>

            <p>On February 9, 2017, there was a major snowstorm in New York City. I always like to venture out on days of inclement weather to photograph. There were very few people out in the streets and most businesses in the financial district were closed. It was a charming moment to see this faithful mail carrier out in the snow and wind, rolling his mail cart along Stone Street, making postal deliveries.

            <p>This photograph was taken on the first night of a workshop taught by my idol, Ernst Haas. Ernst took us to a Noh play being performed at an outside theatre in Tokyo. At one point that night, Ernst came by to see how I was doing; he didn&#x27;t know my name yet. I was using a Nikon FE and a 135 millimeter lens, mounted on a tripod. He glanced at my settings, looked through the lens and then turned to me and whispered: &quot;you&#x27;ll see --- you&#x27;re  going to get something you like&quot;.  That night, after the play, we turned our film in for processing. The next day Ernst looked at our film. My heart skipped a beat when it was my turn and he began to look at my film through his loupe. When he got to this shot, he stopped and studied it. He picked up his head, looked around the room and said with a sense of excitement: &quot;I was standing behind the girl who took this photograph&quot;. When he spotted me, he smiled and said: &quot;I told you you&#x27;d get something you liked!&quot;  It was a major highlight for me and a moment I will never forget. Ernst Haas liked my photograph.

            <p>High near the top of Mount Koya in Japan, Koyasan is a beautiful monastery tucked away in a serene forest. This monk is quietly going about his morning duties in this contemplative area among the ancient cedars.  I took this photograph when I was fortunate enough to take a workshop in Japan taught by my favorite photographer, Ernst Haas. Ernst took us on this long journey to a monastery on the top of Mt. Koyasan. We stayed in the Monastery that night. The grounds were as serene and peaceful as one could imagine. You could feel the spirituality, dedication and honor surrounding you. The monks were quietly going about their day-to-day activities. We were so fortunate to have Ernst expose us to these types of intimate experiences. Every day, he took us to a special place. We visited many Shinto shrines and Buddist temples. Ernst felt if he could immerse us into the culture of Japan and expose us to their traditions, our photographs would reflect a deeper vision. Mt.

            <p>The Giant Panda is a rare and endangered animal with only approximately 2,000 pandas existing in the wild and captivity around the world. The main reason for their decline - the natural habitat is being destroyed due to development of infrastructure, agriculture and declining bamboo forests. Climate change also adds to the stress in their environment. In addition, the female can only get pregnant 2-3 days a year making reproduction a challenge. The Bifengxia Giant Panda Base in Ya&#x27;an is one of the main panda bases in China. This large base offers dense natural forests and abundant waterfalls. They specialize in rescuing, breeding and raising giant pandas. &quot;Panda Kindergarten&quot; had two young Giant Pandas; each one about 10 months old. I spent 5 hours in the rain watching and photographing these two adorable, playful pandas. When pandas are this young, they learn to climb trees in order to protect themselves from predators. This panda climbed up a tall tree and curled up in a little ball. Ya&#x27;an, China. June 2016.</p>

            <h2>Speckled Handball</h2>
            <p>I was taking a workshop taught by the legendary photographer, Jay Maisel. Each day, we were sent out to photograph. On this particular day, I had hit a low point. Sometimes, photography can be frustrating; you can&#x27;t see things in a new and different way. I sat on a bench in Soho for a long time and watched these kids play handball. At one point, the late afternoon sun hit the chain link fence in front of me in such a way, that these highlights appeared on the fence. It&#x27;s amazing how light can so inspiring. I decided to accentuate the highlights and use them as a screen in front of the handball court. Hitting a low point, or failing, often helps you create something good. I was so happy to hear and see Jay&#x27;s reaction to this photograph. He studied it and slowly started to clap his hands. He said he&#x27;d photographed that handball court a hundred times, but never saw it this way. Professional photographers, including Jay, have taught me -- show people something they haven&#x27;t seen before.

            <p>This photograph was taken at a Ticker Tape Parade for the New York Mets who won the World Series Champions in 1986. The parade travels a short distance on Broadway in the financial district of New York City and workers crowd the windows to watch &quot;the heros&quot; and throw streams of paper down onto the street. I call this photograph &quot;Mystery Spectator&quot; because I still can&#x27;t figure out what&#x27;s going on with the shadow of the man behind the window. Is it a TV or is a real person? He just seems misplaced and out of proportion with the rest of the people. Wall Street, New York. October 1986.</p>

            <p>Over the years, when I go to Grand Central Terminal in New York City, I look up at these beautiful, back lit windows hoping that someone will walk by so I can take a photograph. On the days that I see someone walk by, I don&#x27;t have my camera. If I have my camera, no one walks by. Today was my lucky day. As Grand Central Terminal celebrates it&#x27;s 100th year anniversary this year and proudly displays &quot;100&quot; across three windows, I was able to photograph people simultaneously on different levels completely unaware of each other.

            <p>There’s an old saying that describes Wall Street as: “a river on one side and a cemetery on the other”. The cemetery is right next to Trinity Church. Back in 1981 when I took this photograph, the steeple of Trinity Church was caked with multiple layers of black soot that had accumulated over many years. Several years later after I took this photograph, they blasted the soot off the steeple and restored it to its original condition. The original color is a reddish/rose color with intricate details.

            <h2>Along the Turquoise Trail</h2>
            <p>I was in Albuquerque New Mexico and needed to drive to Santa Fe. I had heard about the scenic &quot;Turquiose Trail&quot; the off-the-beaten-track road. Prior to my trip, I had read about a little ghost town called Cerrillos. Sure enough, off the Turquiose Trail, a long dusty, dirt road lead me to this little town. It was high noon, a hot afternoon, and no one was around. The was a little general store with the lights out, but someone was there to sell me water. The light was what Sam Abell would call &quot;hard ball light&quot;; that bright washed-out light with harsh shadows and no detail in the sky. About 1:30 pm, I spotted this cowboy riding his horse, but the light was so awful. I asked him where he&#x27;d be around 6 pm and he explained a slow, relaxed drawl, that he was taking his horse out for a ride and he would be back at the salon around 6 pm. I told him I&#x27;d see him then. Afterall, with that turquoise ring, blue work shirt, and cowboy hat, who could resist the chance to photograph him? So I waited for 4-1/2 hours. Sure enough he came plodding up to the salon around 6 pm. The sun was now throwing off that delicious golden light. The wood of the salon and the tan color of his skin were almost identical. It was worth waiting for -- the cowboy in the ghost town on the Turquiose Trail. Cerrillos, New Mexico. July 1993.</p>

            <h2>An Afternoon Tale</h2>
            <p>Ten years prior to this photograph, I was fortunate enough to have taken a workshop in Japan taught by my favorite photographer, Ernst Haas. One day while we were traveling on a bus, Ernst came over to my seat and sat next to me. It was such a thrill for me to have this private moment with him. In the course of our conversation, Ernst said to me: “Nancy, you must promise me that one day you will go to Venice in October and New Zealand in May – the light is spectacular that time of year.” Ten years later, I went to Venice by myself. Every day, I would just walk around Venice, get completely lost, and not care in the least. Like a horse at the end of a trail ride, I knew I would eventually find my way home. One day, as I rounded a corner, I gasped at the scene I saw ahead of me and hid against the nearest wall. The wooden artist palate with paint colors caught my eye first. Then I saw a boy wearing a red shirt standing in the window. As I looked closer, I saw he was playing with an orange cat sitting in a window box in front of him two stories above the ground.  There was a trail of red geraniums draping down the side. It was one of those moments when my heart was beating so hard I thought it would burst out of my chest. The scene was perfect and as Haas had promised, the light bouncing off all the adjacent walls had a warm quality that created a warm, soft ambiance. This is the moment when you hope with all your might you can execute the shot perfectly and not lose the moment. I was able to shot a few frames before the boy saw me and melted away from the window. Every time I look at this photograph, I remember the scene and my fast heartbeat as though it were yesterday. I think of Ernst Haas, smile and quietly thank him.  Venice, Italy. October 1993.</p>

This was one time I thought I might die taking a photograph. Right beyond this ledge, the drop so suddenly and so high up, there would have been no chance to survive the fall. When the camera is up to my eye, it is not uncommon for me to walk to get the right frame. Thank goodness I had a moment of clarity.

            <p>&quot;Craters-on-the-Moon&quot; is about 4km north of Taupo. I hiked there very early in the morning, and the entire place was bubbling and gurgling beneath my feet. I was by myself and no one else was there. It was as though I was witnessing the Earth being formed right before my eyes and under my feet. There is a great deal of thermal activity here due to the Tectonic plate movement under New Zealand. Taupo, North Island, New Zealand. May 1994.</p>

            <h2>Phoenix and Akeakamai</h2>
            <p>I spent two weeks with these two dolphins, Phoenix and Akeakamai.  I was a volunteer for Earthwatch, a non-profit organization that runs programs concerning various environmental issues around the world. This particular program involved communicating with dolphins and understanding their level of intelligence. This lab ran like a fine swiss watch. Every day there was a fully-packed schedule that ran on time with very specific training, even for the volunteers. They were always taking detailed notes, including written observations, video, audio for every activity with the dolphins. The training drills for the dolphins tested their memory, yes/no questions, instructions requiring the dolphins to know the difference between their left and right, and direct and indirect verbs. It was beyond fascinating for me to see these tests and take part in activities at the lab. There was also play time with the dolphins, but the best part of all, was getting a chance to swim with them underwater. One day, I stayed late to photograph them. When I put my slides on the light table when I returned home to NY, both dolphins were looking into the camera in every single frame. Just before I had arrived for the program, the leader of the project, Louis Herman, was credited for luring a lost humpback whale, Humphrey, out of San Francisco Bay with feeding sounds rather than scaring him as others had suggested. By the time I arrived at the lab, the news organizations were there interviewing Herman and filming the dolphins. I remember the dolphins showing off for the cameras as they kept leaping out of the water behind Herman as he was being interviewed. I also remember how when I first arrived, these two dolphins checked me out; both next to each other with their heads propped up on the edge of the pool just taking a good look at me. These two weeks ranked very high in my most memorable life time experiences. Honolulu, Hawaii. Kewalo Basin Marine Mammal Laboratory.  November 1985.</p>

            <h2>Surprised Sea Otter</h2>
            <p>This was one very remote place in Alaska; it doesn&#x27;t even show up on a map. Alaska is huge, and I realized on this day, that no one, absolutely no one, knew where I was at that moment. I was staying at a terrific lodge on Kachemack Bay, which is about a 45 minute power boat ride from Homer. On this particular day, I had wanted to photograph sea otters. The lodge gave me a head start by strapping a kayak on a power boat, drove about half hour west and dumped me in a remote part of the bay. It was such a peaceful, wonderful feeling to sit low in the water and witness the amazing nature in Alaska. This poor little sea otter was asleep in a kelp bed. I didn&#x27;t want to scare him, but I really wanted to get as close as I could to photograph him. He was sound asleep -- well -- until I got really close to him. Every time I look at this photograph, I giggle. He is just so adorable! Cohen Bay, Alaska.  May 1995.</p>

            <h2>Ice Cave</h2>
            <p>On this particular day, I was making my way to an island in Prince William Sound where I was going to be camping for the night. As our motor boat approached the island, I saw the way the light was hitting this one particular iceberg in the sound. As soon as we landed, I got into a kayak and slowly made my way over to this iceberg to photograph it. I underestimated the power of icebergs. They can be deceptively deep, quite big and dangerous to get to close since they are constantly moving and turning over. I&#x27;m always amused at the reaction I received when I show people this photograph without telling them anything about it. Most people think it is a very large iceberg and that the hole is enormous. The opening is actually only about 2-3 feet. Prince William Sound, Alaska. May 1995.</p>

            <h2>Negotiating Rainstorm</h2>
            <p>I was on my way to work, crossing the pedestrian bridge over The West Side Highway by Ground Zero. A torrential rainstorm suddenly hit. As I was standing under cover on the bridge,  I starting taking photographs of people trying to deal with this impossible rainstorm. I was photographing the man in the foreground with the white umbrella, when by a stroke of good luck, the second man with the black umbrella entered my frame. The similarities and contrasts continue to intrigue me. I was thrilled that their umbrellas aren&#x27;t touching in the photograph. Thank you Henri-Cartier Bresson for making me aware of &quot;the decisive moment&quot;. A note about cameras -- the best camera is the one in your hands. This was taken with a Canon G10 that I carried in my pocketbook. Ground Zero. New York City. 2010.</p>

            <p>I call this photograph my &quot;Jay Maisel Moment&quot;. One of Jay&#x27;s many, many principles is: &quot;A happy photographer, is a good photographer&quot;. He is referring to taking the time to shoot for yourself, even if you&#x27;re in the middle of a job or other obligation. In this case, I was about to take a snapshot with my Canon G10, of two famous photographers, Eric Meola and Seth Resnick standing arm-in-arm, smiling for me in front of the hotel. Now these are two people who do not like to be told to &quot;wait, just one minute&quot; while some amateur photographer fumbles around for a point-and-shoot camera.   What they didn’t realize at that moment, it wasn’t them that I was now interested in photographing. Right above their heads, there was a piece of art hanging high in the lobby behind a glass overhang. It was pouring rain and there was a sheet of raindrops on the glass creating a mosaic of the art. Once again, I loved the abstract created by the glass and the rain. I had to take a minute to shoot an image for myself. Reykavik, Iceland. May 2010</p>
